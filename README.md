# Blood Donation Mobile Application
We conducted a survey among random users to identify the user and organizational requirements and came up with our blood donation app which was then followed by user tests to evaluate if the system satisfies the requirements. The app identifies and locates the nearest donors whose blood type match the urgent needs of medical centers.
